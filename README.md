## Start the application using uvicorn
```
uvicorn main:app --port 8000 --reload
```
Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Personal Reminder)

## How it works
You can manually input the Title, Artist, Duration, and Genre for a music track and click Add Track to populate the list of tracks. You can add as many tracks as you like.  

You can then Update a track with a new Title, Artist, Duration, or Genre if need be.   

You can also click Delete to remove tracks from the list.
